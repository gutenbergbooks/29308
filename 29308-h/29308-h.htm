world</b></h1>

<h2><small><i>by WILLIAM F. NOLAN</i></small></h2>

<p class="pr1"><big><b>He was running, running down the long tunnels, the
shadows hunting him, claws clutching at him, nearer ...</b></big></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">In the</span> waiting windless
dark, Lewis Stillman pressed
into the building-front shadows
along Wilshire Boulevard.
Breathing softly, the
automatic poised and ready in
his hand, he advanced with
animal stealth toward Western,
gliding over the night-cool
concrete, past ravaged
clothing shops, drug and ten-cent
stores, their windows
shattered, their doors ajar and
swinging. The city of Los
Angeles, painted in cold
moonlight, was an immense
graveyard; the tall white
tombstone buildings thrust
up from the silent pavement,
shadow-carved and lonely.
Overturned metal corpses of
trucks, busses and automobiles
littered the streets.</p>

<p>He paused under the wide
marquee of the FOX WILTERN.
Above his head, rows
of splintered display bulbs
gaped&mdash;sharp glass teeth in
wooden jaws. Lewis Stillman
felt as though they might
drop at any moment to pierce
his body.</p>

<p>Four more blocks to cover.
His destination: a small corner
delicatessen four blocks
south of Wilshire, on Western.
Tonight he intended bypassing
the larger stores like
Safeway or Thriftimart, with
their available supplies of exotic
foods; a smaller grocery
was far more likely to have
what he needed. He was finding
it more and more difficult
to locate basic food
stuffs. In the big supermarkets
only the more exotic and
highly spiced canned and bottled
goods remained&mdash;and he
was sick of caviar and oysters!</p>

<p>Crossing Western, he had
almost reached the far curb
when he saw some of <i>them</i>.
He dropped immediately to
his knees behind the rusting
bulk of an Olds 88. The rear
door on his side was open,
and he cautiously eased himself
into the back seat of the
deserted car. Releasing the
safety catch on the automatic,
he peered through the
cracked window at six or
seven of them, as they moved
toward him along the street.
God! Had he been seen? He
couldn't be sure. Perhaps they
were aware of his position!
He should have remained on
the open street where he'd
have a running chance. Perhaps,
if his aim were true, he
could kill most of them; but,
even with its silencer, the
gun would be heard and more
of them would come. He
dared not fire until he was
certain they discovered him.</p>

<p>They came closer, their
small dark bodies
crowding the walk, six of
them, chattering, leaping,
cruel mouths open, eyes glittering
under the moon. Closer.
The shrill pipings increased,
rose in volume. Closer.
Now he could make out
their sharp teeth and matted
hair. Only a few feet from the
car ... His hand was moist on
the handle of the automatic;
his heart thundered against
his chest. Seconds away ...</p>

<p>Now!</p>

<p>Lewis Stillman fell heavily
back against the dusty seat-cushion,
the gun loose in his
trembling hand. They had
passed by; they had missed
him. Their thin pipings diminished,
grew faint with
distance.</p>

<p>The tomb silence of late
night settled around him.</p>

<hr />

<p>The delicatessen proved a
real windfall. The shelves
were relatively untouched and
he had a wide choice of
tinned goods. He found an
empty cardboard box and hastily
began to transfer the
cans from the shelf nearest
him.</p>

<p>A noise from behind&mdash;a
padding, scraping sound.</p>

<p>Lewis Stillman whirled
around, the automatic ready.</p>

<p>A huge mongrel dog faced
him, growling deep in its
throat, four legs braced for
assault. The blunt ears were
laid flat along the short-haired
skull and a thin trickle
of saliva seeped from the killing
jaws. The beast's powerful
chest-muscles were
bunched for the spring when
Stillman acted.</p>

<p>The gun, he knew, was useless;
the shots would be
heard. Therefore, with the
full strength of his left arm,
he hurled a heavy can at the
dog's head. The stunned animal
staggered under the
blow, legs buckling. Hurriedly,
Stillman gathered his supplies
and made his way back to the
street.</p>

<p>How much longer can my
luck hold? Lewis Stillman
wondered, as he bolted the
door. He placed the box of
tinned goods on a wooden
table and lit the tall lamp
nearby. Its flickering orange
glow illumined the narrow,
low-ceilinged room as Stillman
seated himself on one of
three chairs facing the table.</p>

<p>Twice tonight, his mind
told him, twice you've escaped
them&mdash;and they could
have seen you easily on both
occasions if they had been
watching for you. They don't
know you're alive. But when
they find out ...</p>

<p>He forced his thoughts
away from the scene in his
mind away from the horror;
quickly he stood up and began
to unload the box, placing
the cans on a long shelf
along the far side of the
room.</p>

<p>He began to think of women,
of a girl named Joan, and
of how much he had loved
her ...</p>

<hr />

<p>The world of Lewis Stillman
was damp and lightless;
it was narrow and its cold
stone walls pressed in upon
him as he moved. He had
been walking for several
hours; sometimes he would
run, because he knew his leg
muscles must be kept strong,
but he was walking now, following
the thin yellow beam
of his hooded lantern. He was
searching.</p>

<p>Tonight, he thought, I
might find another like myself.
Surely, <i>someone</i> is down
here; I'll find someone if I
keep searching. I <i>must</i> find
someone!</p>

<p>But he knew he would not.
He knew he would find only
chill emptiness ahead of him
in the tunnels.</p>

<p>For three long years he had
been searching for another
man or woman down here in
this world under the city. For
three years he had prowled
the seven hundred miles of
storm drains which threaded
their way under the skin of
Los Angeles like the veins in
a giant's body&mdash;and he had
found nothing. <i>Nothing.</i></p>

<p>Even now, after all the days
and nights of search, he
could not really accept the
fact that he was alone, that
he was the last man alive in
a city of seven million, that
all the others were dead.</p>

<p>He paused, resting his back
against the cold stone. Some
of them were moving over the
street above his head. He listened
to the sharp scuffling
sounds on the pavement and
swore bitterly.</p>

<p>"Damn you," said Lewis
Stillman levelly. "Damn all of
you!"</p>

<hr />

<p>Lewis Stillman was running
down the long tunnels.
Behind him a tide of midget
shadows washed from wall to
wall; high keening cries, doubled
and tripled by echoes,
rang in his ears. Claws
reached for him; he felt panting
breath, like hot smoke, on
the back of his neck; his
lungs were bursting, his entire
body aflame.</p>

<p>He looked down at his fast-pumping
legs, doing their job
with pistoned precision. He
listened to the sharp slap of
his heels against the floor of
the tunnel&mdash;and he thought:
I might die at any moment,
but my <i>legs</i> will escape! They
will run on down the endless
drains and never be caught.
They move so fast while my
heavy awkward upper-body
rocks and sways above them,
slowing them down, tiring
them&mdash;making them angry.
How my legs must hate me! I
must be clever and humor
them, beg them to take me
along to safety. How well
they run, how sleek and fine!</p>

<p>Then he felt himself coming
apart. His legs were detaching
themselves from his
upper-body. He cried out in
horror, flailing the air with
his arms, beseeching them not
to leave him behind. But the
legs cruelly continued to unfasten
themselves. In a cold
surge of terror, Lewis Stillman
felt himself tipping, falling
toward the damp floor&mdash;while
his legs raced on with a
wild animal life of their own.
He opened his mouth, high
above the insane legs, and
screamed.</p>

<p>Ending the nightmare.</p>

<p>He sat up stiffly in his cot,
gasping, drenched in sweat.
He drew in a long shuddering
breath and reached for a cigarette.
He lit it with a trembling
hand.</p>

<p>The nightmares were getting
worse. He realized that
his mind was rebelling as he
slept, spilling forth the bottled-up
fears of the day during
the night hours.</p>

<p>He thought once more
about the beginning six years
ago, about why he was still
alive, the last of his kind. The
alien ships had struck Earth
suddenly, without warning.
Their attack had been
thorough and deadly. In a
matter of hours the aliens had
accomplished their clever
mission&mdash;and the men and
women of Earth were destroyed.
A few survived, he
was certain. He had never
met any of them, but he was
convinced they existed. Los
Angeles was not the world,
after all, and if <i>he</i> escaped so
must have others around the
globe. He'd been working
alone in the drains when the
alien ships appeared, finishing
a special job for the construction
company on B tunnel.
He could still hear the
weird sound of the mammoth
ships and feel the intense
heat of their passage.</p>

<p>Hunger had forced him out
and overnight he became a
curiosity. The last man alive.
For three years he was not
harmed. He worked with
them, taught them many
things, and tried to win their
confidence. But, eventually,
certain ones came to hate him,
to be jealous of his relationship
with the others. Luckily
he had been able to escape to
the drains. That was three
years ago and now they had
forgotten him.</p>

<p>His later excursions to
the upper level of the city had
been made under cover of
darkness&mdash;and he never ventured
out unless his food supply
dwindled. Water was provided
by rain during the wet-months&mdash;and
by bottled liquids
during the dry.</p>

<p>He had built his one-room
structure directly to the side
of an overhead grating&mdash;not
close enough to risk their
seeing it, but close enough
for light to seep in during the
sunlight hours. He missed the
warm feel of open sun on his
body almost as much as he
missed the companionship of
others, but he could not
think of risking himself above
the drains by day.</p>

<p>Sometimes he got insane
thoughts. Sometimes, when
the loneliness closed in like
an immense fist and he could
no longer stand the sound
of his own voice, he would
think of bringing one of them
down with him, into the
drains. One at a time, they
could be handled. Then he'd
remember their sharp savage
eyes, their animal ferocity,
and he would realize that the
idea was impossible. If one of
their kind disappeared, suddenly
and without trace, others
would certainly become
suspicious, begin to search for
him&mdash;and it would all be over.</p>

<p>Lewis Stillman settled back
into his pillow, pulling the
blankets tight about his body.
He closed his eyes and tried
not to listen to the distant
screams, pipings and reedy
cries filtering down from the
street above his head.</p>

<p>Finally he slept.</p>

<hr />

<p>He spent the afternoon
with paper women. He lingered
over the pages of some
yellowed fashion magazines,
looking at all the beautifully
photographed models in their
fine clothes. All slim and enchanting,
these page-women,
with their cool enticing eyes
and perfect smiles, all grace
and softness and glitter and
swirled cloth. He touched
their images with gentle fingers,
stroking the tawny paper
hair, as though, by some
magic formula, he might imbue
them with life. It was
easy to imagine that these
women had never really lived
at all&mdash;that they were simply
painted, in microscopic detail,
by sly artists to give the
illusion of photos. He didn't
like to think about these
women and how they died.</p>

<p>That evening Lewis Stillman
watched the moon, round
and high and yellow in the
night sky, and he thought of
his father, and of the long
hikes through the moonlit
Maine countryside, of hunting
trips and warm campfires,
of the Maine woods, rich and
green in summer. He thought
of his father's hopes for his
future and the words of that
tall, gray-haired figure came
back to him.</p>

<p>"<i>You'll be a fine doctor,
Lewis. Study and work hard
and you'll succeed. I know
you will.</i>"</p>

<p>He remembered the long
winter evenings of study at
his father's great mahogany
desk, pouring over medical
books and journals, taking
notes, sifting and re-sifting
facts. He remembered one set
of books in particular&mdash;Erickson's
monumental three-volume
text on surgery, richly
bound and stamped in gold.
He had always loved these
books, above all others.</p>

<p>What had gone wrong
along the way? Somehow, the
dream had faded, the bright
goal vanished and was lost.
After a year of pre-med at
the University of Southern
Cal, he had given up medicine;
he had become discouraged
and quit college to take
a laborer's job with a construction
company. How
ironic that this move should
have saved his life! He'd
wanted to work with his
hands, to sweat and labor
with the muscles of his body.
He'd wanted to earn enough
to marry Joan and then, later
perhaps, he would have returned
to finish his courses.
It all seemed so far away
now, his reason for quitting,
for letting his father down.</p>

<p>Now, at this moment, an
overwhelming desire gripped
him, a desire to pour over
Erickson's pages once again,
to re-create, even for a brief
moment, the comfort and happiness
of his childhood.</p>

<p>He'd seen a duplicate set on
the second floor of Pickwick's
book store in Hollywood, in
their used book department,
and now he knew he must go
after them, bring the books
back with him to the drains.
It was a dangerous and foolish
desire, but he knew he
would obey it. Despite the
risk of death, he would go after
the books tonight. <i>Tonight.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>One corner of Lewis Stillman's
room was reserved for
weapons. His prize, a Thompson
submachine, had been procured
from the Los Angeles
police arsenal. Supplementing
the Thompson were two semi-automatic
rifles, a Luger, a
Colt .45 and a .22-caliber Hornet
pistol, equipped with a
silencer. He always kept the
smallest gun in a spring-clip
holster beneath his armpit,
but it was not his habit to carry
any of the larger weapons
with him into the city. On this
night, however, things were
different.</p>

<p>The drains ended two
miles short of Hollywood&mdash;which
means he would be
forced to cover a long and
particularly hazardous stretch
of ground in order to reach
the book store. He therefore
decided to take along the .30-caliber
Savage rifle in addition
to the small hand weapon.</p>

<p>You're a fool, Lewis, he told
himself, as he slid the oiled
Savage from its leather case.
Are the books important
enough to risk your life? Yes,
another part of him replied,
they <i>are</i> that important. If
you want a thing badly
enough and the thing is
worthwhile, then you must go
after it. If fear holds you like
a rat in the dark, then you are
worse than a coward; you betray
yourself and the civilization
you represent. Go out
and bring the books back.</p>

<p>Running in the chill night
wind. Grass, now pavement,
now grass, beneath his feet.
Ducking into shadows, moving
stealthily past shops and
theatres, rushing under the
cold moon. Santa Monica
Boulevard, then Highland,
the Hollywood Boulevard, and
finally&mdash;after an eternity of
heartbeats&mdash;the book store.</p>

<p>Pickwick's.</p>

<p>Lewis Stillman, his rifle
over one shoulder, the small
automatic gleaming in his
hand, edged silently into the
store.</p>

<p>A paper battleground met
his eyes.</p>

<p>In the filtered moonlight, a
white blanket of broken-backed
volumes spilled across
the entire lower floor. Stillman
shuddered; he could envision
them, shrieking, scrabbling
at the shelves, throwing
books wildly across the room
at one another. Screaming,
ripping, destroying.</p>

<p>What of the other floors?
<i>What of the medical section?</i></p>

<p>He crossed to the stairs,
spilled pages crackling like a
fall of dry leaves under his
step, and sprinted up the first
short flight to the mezzanine.
Similar chaos!</p>

<p>He hurried up to the second
floor, stumbling, terribly
afraid of what he might find.
Reaching the top, his heart
thudding, he squinted into the
dimness.</p>

<p>The books were undisturbed.
Apparently they had
tired of their game before
reaching these.</p>

<p>He slipped the rifle from
his shoulder and placed it
near the stairs. Dust lay
thick all around him, powdering
up and swirling, as he
moved down the narrow
aisles; a damp, leathery
mustiness lived in the air, an
odor of mold and neglect.</p>

<p>Lewis Stillman paused before
a dim hand-lettered sign:
MEDICAL SECTION. It was
just as he had remembered it.
Holstering the small automatic,
he struck a match, shading
the flame with a cupped
hand as he moved it along the
rows of faded titles. Carter ...
Davidson ... Enright ...
<i>Erickson</i>. He drew in his
breath sharply. All three volumes,
their gold stamping
dust-dulled but readable,
stood in tall and perfect order
on the shelf.</p>

<p>In the darkness, Lewis
Stillman carefully removed
each volume, blowing it free
of dust. At last all three books
were clean and solid in his
hands.</p>

<p>Well, you've done it. You've
reached the books and now
they belong to you.</p>

<p>He smiled, thinking of the
moment when he would be
able to sit down at the table
with his treasure, and linger
again and again over the wonderous
pages.</p>

<p>He found an empty carton
at the rear of the store and
placed the books inside. Returning
to the stairs, he shouldered
the rifle and began his
descent to the lower floor.</p>

<p>So far, he told himself, my
luck is still holding.</p>

<p>But as Lewis Stillman's
foot touched the final stair,
his luck ran out.</p>

<p>The entire lower floor was
alive with them!</p>

<p>Rustling like a mass of
great insects, gliding toward
him, eyes gleaming in the
half-light, they converged
upon the stairs. They had
been waiting for him.</p>

<p>Now, suddenly, the books
no longer mattered. Now only
his life mattered and nothing
else. He moved back against
the hard wood of the stair-rail,
the carton of books sliding
from his hands. They
had stopped at the foot of the
stair; they were silent, looking
up at him, the hate in
their eyes.</p>

<p>If you can reach the street,
Stillman told himself, then
you've still got half a chance.
That means you've got to get
through them to the door. All
right then, <i>move</i>.</p>

<p>Lewis Stillman squeezed
the trigger of the automatic
and three shots echoed
through the silent store. Two
of them fell under the bullets
as Stillman rushed into their
midst.</p>

<p>He felt sharp nails claw at
his shirt and trousers, heard
the cloth ripping away in
their grasp. He kept firing the
small automatic into them,
and three more dropped under
the hail of bullets, shrieking
in pain and surprise. The
others spilled back, screaming,
from the door.</p>

<p>The gun was empty. He
tossed it away, swinging the
heavy Savage rifle free from
his shoulder as he reached the
street. The night air, crisp
and cool in his lungs, gave
him instant hope.</p>

<p>I can still make it, thought
Stillman, as he leaped the curb
and plunged across the pavement.
If those shots weren't
heard, then I've still got the
edge. My legs are strong; I
can outdistance them.</p>

<p>Luck, however, had failed
him completely on this night.
Near the intersection of Hollywood
Boulevard and Highland,
a fresh pack of them
swarmed toward him over the
street.</p>

<p>He dropped to one knee
and fired into their ranks, the
Savage jerking in his hands.
They scattered to either side.</p>

<p>He began to run steadily
down the middle of Hollywood
Boulevard, using the
butt of the heavy rifle like
a battering ram as they came
at him. As he neared Highland,
three of them darted directly
into his path. Stillman
fired. One doubled over, lurching
crazily into a jagged
plate-glass store front. Another
clawed at him as he swept
around the corner to Highland.
He managed to shake free.</p>

<p>The street ahead of him was
clear. Now his superior leg-power
would count heavily in
his favor. Two miles. Could
he make it back before others
cut him off?</p>

<p>Running, re-loading, firing.
Sweat soaking his shirt, rivering
down his face, stinging
his eyes. A mile covered. Half
way to the drains. They had
fallen back.</p>

<p>But more of them were
coming, drawn by the rifle
shots, pouring in from side
streets, stores and houses.</p>

<p>His heart jarred in his
body, his breath was ragged.
How many of them around
him? A hundred? Two hundred?
More coming. God!</p>

<p>He bit down on his lower
lip until the salt taste of blood
was on his tongue. You can't
make it, a voice inside him
shouted, they'll have you in
another block and you know
it!</p>

<p>He fitted the rifle to his
shoulder, adjusted his aim,
and fired. The long rolling
crack of the big weapon filled
the night. Again and again he
fired, the butt jerking into the
flesh of his shoulder, the
smell of powder in his nostrils.</p>

<p>It was no use. Too many of
them.</p>

<p>Lewis Stillman knew that
he was going to die.</p>

<p>The rifle was empty at
last, the final bullet had been
fired. He had no place to run
because they were all around
him, in a slowly closing circle.</p>

<p>He looked at the ring of
small cruel faces and he
thought: The aliens did their
job perfectly; they stopped
Earth before she could reach
the age of the rocket, before
she could threaten planets beyond
her own moon. What an
immensely clever plan it had
been! To destroy every human
being on Earth above the
age of six&mdash;and then to leave
as quickly as they had come,
allowing our civilization to
continue on a primitive level,
knowing that Earth's back had
been broken, that her survivors
would revert to savagery
as they grew into adulthood.</p>

<p>Lewis Stillman dropped the
empty rifle at his feet and
threw out his hands. "Listen,"
he pleaded, "I'm really one of
you. You'll <i>all</i> be like me
soon. Please, <i>listen</i> to me."</p>

<p>But the circle tightened relentlessly
around Lewis Stillman.
He was screaming when
the children closed in.</p>
